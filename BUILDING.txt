
  Membrane Builing Instructions
==================================================================
1. Install JDK 1.6 or higher.
2. Install Maven 3.
3. Run "mvn install" in \membrane-esb\ .
4. Run "mvn install" in \membrane-monitor\ .

(Putting both Maven modules into one reactor build is not possible
because maven-bundle-plugin and tycho-maven-plugin are incompatible
with project references between projects using them.)




  Release Instructions
==================================================================

Also see https://predic8.com/svn/membrane/monitor/branches/3.2.X/com.predic8.membrane.core/doc/building-a-distribution.txt .
The detailed test instructions, publication and homepage changes are to be integrated.

0. Ensure that your ~/.m2/settings.xml authorizes you to push 
   packages into the Maven repository at
   http://repository.membrane-soa.org . 

1. Run all tests locally ("mvn integration-test" in both
   membrane-esb and membrane-monitor).
   
2. Increment Version, for example from 3.3.5-SNAPSHOT to 3.3.5:

   a. In all pom.xml files:
      In every pom.xml exactly one <version>-Element is to be
      changed: in the two root pom.xml files (membrane-esb\pom.xml
      and membrane-monitor\pom.xml) //project/version is to be
      changed; in all other pom.xml files //project/parent/version
      is to be changed.
   
   b. In all membrane-monitor/*/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF files,
      change "Bundle-Version". Note that the "-SNAPSHOT" suffix of
      the Maven version translates into the suffix ".qualifier"
      here.

3. Run "mvn deploy -DskipTests" first in \membrane-esb\, then in
   \membrane-monitor\ . (Note that this deployment can only
   be done once for non-SNAPSHOT releases.)   

4. Increment Version again (repeat step 2), now for example from
   3.3.5 to 3.3.6-SNAPSHOT.

5. Check in your changes to the pom.xml and MANIFEST.MF files.
