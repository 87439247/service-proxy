SSL for Unsecured Servers

Using the Membrane ESB we can enable clients that do not support SSL to communicate with a SSL secured server.  




RUNNING THE EXAMPLE

In the example we will connect to the following SVN repository without using SSL.
 
 
https://predic8.com/svn/membrane/monitor/


To run the example execute the following steps:

1. Execute router.bat

2. Open the URL http://localhost:8080/svn/membrane/monitor/ in your browser.
