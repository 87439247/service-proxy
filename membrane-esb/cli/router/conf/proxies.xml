<!--
	Routing Configuration
	
	Here you can configure routing rules for Membrane Monitor and ESB. It
	contains some rules to show how to setup routing. Please make sure to
	remove these rules before you put the router into production. More sample
	configurations you can find in the examples directory.

	Have a look at
	http://membrane-soa.org/esb-doc/current/configuration/proxy-configuration.htm for
	documentation and a reference explaining what XML elements can be used
	how and where.
	
	See the *.proxies.xml files in the /examples/* directories in the ESB
	distribution for several examples of how to configure different ESB
	features within this file.
